# Text Emotion Classification

## üìå Project Overview
Text Emotion Classification is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) task where the goal is to classify a given text into different emotion categories such as **happy, sad, angry, fear, surprise, and love**.  
This project leverages Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques to automate the detection of emotions in text data.

---

## üöÄ Features
- Preprocessing of raw text data (cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal).
- Feature extraction using **TF-IDF** or **Word Embeddings**.
- Training models for emotion classification.
- Evaluation with metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score.
- Visualization of model performance (Confusion Matrix, Accuracy/Loss curves).

---

## üìÇ Dataset
- The dataset contains **text samples** labeled with corresponding **emotions**.
- Preprocessing steps include:
  - Lowercasing & punctuation removal
  - Tokenization
  - Stopword removal
  - Vectorization (TF-IDF or word embeddings)

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **TensorFlow / Keras**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Pandas, NumPy**
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn**

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Workflow
1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing**
   - Load dataset, clean text, and prepare features.
2. **Model Building**
   - Train ML/DL models (Logistic Regression, SVM, LSTM, etc.).
3. **Evaluation**
   - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score.
   - Confusion Matrix & Performance plots.
4. **Results**
   - Model achieves good accuracy in classifying emotions.

---

## üìä Results
- Models successfully classify text into multiple emotions.
- Achieved strong accuracy and balanced performance across classes.
- Visual evaluation through confusion matrix and accuracy/loss curves.

---

## üîÆ Future Work
- Use larger and more diverse datasets.
- Implement advanced architectures like **Transformers (BERT, RoBERTa)**.
- Real-time emotion classification in applications such as **chatbots** and **sentiment analysis tools**.
